# Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a logic next step on your journey to run containers in a production environment. Docker offer you an great developer experience, but does not scale well in a complex production deployment.

Kubernetes offers you a great abstraction of “where” the cluster is running: it can work on a in-house cluster, or maybe on a cloud provider (AKS)

Understanding how to setup a Kubernetes cluster help you understand what happens “under the hood” when using Kubernetes.
