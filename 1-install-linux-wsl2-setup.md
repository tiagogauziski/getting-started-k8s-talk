# WSL2 - The Windows hack to run Linux workloads

Using WSL2 is the easiest and lighter way to run Linux within Windows OS. Itâ€™s pretty straight forward to use and all images you can download from Windows Store.

# Disable `swap` - we will need that later

Kubernetes does not like swap files in Linux. We will need to disable it otherwise `kubeadm` will fail to setup a cluster. Even if you disable using `swapoff -a` , if you restart your machine, swap will come back to haunt you.

Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#wslconfig

- Open `%UserProfile%` on your explorer
- Create `.wslconfig` file
- Add the following contents on it

```powershell
# Settings apply across all Linux distros running on WSL 2
[wsl2]

# How much swap space to add to the WSL 2 VM, 0 for no swap file. Swap storage is disk-based RAM used when memory demand exceeds limit on hardware device.
swap=0
```

- If you have running instance already, you need to reboot WSL2 distribution

```powershell
# List all distros that are running
wsl.exe -l -v

# Terminate a specific distribution
wsl.exe -t Ubuntu-24.04

# Boot up a specific distribution
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

## Create WSL instance

- Download from Windows Store - Ubuntu 24.04

![Windows Store](/img/install-linux-wsl2-windows-store.png)

- Setup user and password
- Open Terminal and connect to the distribution

```powershell
# Launch the instance via wsl command
# Replace the -u USER with the user you had setup on the installation steps of the distribution
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 -u tiago
```
